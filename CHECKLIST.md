# Master Checklist
- Using term consistently across the whole book. Using footnotes for short explanation and using glossary for long explanation.
- Acronyms must be fully written and bold in the initial usage then you can use parentheses to denote it for later use.
- Here are the guidelines for acronyms:

    - Don't define acronyms that would only be used a few times.
    - Do define acronyms that meet both of the following criteria:
        - The acronym is significantly shorter than the full term.
        - The acronym appears many times in the document.
- Consider the following pronoun guidelines:
    - Only use a pronoun after you've introduced the noun; never use the pronoun before you've introduced the noun.
    - Place the pronoun as close as possible to the referring noun. As a rule of thumb, if more than five words separate your noun from your pronoun, consider repeating the noun instead of using the pronoun.
    - If you introduce a second noun between your noun and your pronoun, reuse your noun instead of using a pronoun.
